# Contributing

- Use short-lived branches and frequent merges to `main` (trunk-based).
- Open a draft PR early; CI must pass before merge.
- Follow Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Write tests alongside code; put broader integration/e2e tests under `tests/`.
- See `.github/` for issue/PR templates and CI.
