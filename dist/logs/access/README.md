# Refined export access logs

Store hashed access manifests for refined exports in this folder. Each file should include a
SHA256 checksum, requester metadata, and expiry timestamp to satisfy SOC 2 confidentiality
controls. Rotate entries quarterly after ensuring evidence snapshots exist in the central
catalog.
