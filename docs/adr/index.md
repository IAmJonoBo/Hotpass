# Architecture decisions index

The Hotpass ADRs capture architectural and governance decisions using the MADR
format. This index highlights the current state of each decision and how the
latest documentation work (including the refreshed Data Docs and lineage
navigation) keeps the guidance actionable.

## Documentation strategy alignment

- **Di√°taxis enforcement:** The landing page now exposes governance artefacts
  (Data Docs, schema exports, Marquez quickstart) up front, satisfying the
  visibility goals from [ADR-0002](0002-governance-automation.md) and the
  documentation commitments in [ADR-0004](0004-checkpoint-validation-strategy.md).
- **Telemetry bootstrap coverage:** Updates remain consistent with
  [ADR-0006](0006-telemetry-bootstrap.md) by linking observability material from
  the same hub.
- **Future work:** Planned PRs for `hotpass doctor` / `init` will close the loop
  on the UX guarantees described in [docs/roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) and surfaced
  in the repository-level `ROADMAP.md`.
- **CLI onboarding:** `hotpass init` and `hotpass doctor` now land as part of the
  quickstart workflow, addressing the UX commitments captured in ROADMAP.md.

| [0004](0004-checkpoint-validation-strategy.md) | Checkpoint validation strategy | Accepted | Documentation now links directly to Data Docs and refresh tooling. |
| [0005](0005-prefect-deployment-manifests.md) | Prefect deployment manifests | Proposed | Pending PR `prefect/deployment-manifests`; status tracked in ROADMAP.md. |
| [0006](0006-telemetry-bootstrap.md) | Telemetry bootstrap | Accepted | Observability docs and quickstarts align with the bootstrap decision. |
| [0006B](0006-mlflow-lifecycle-strategy.md) | MLflow lifecycle strategy | Accepted | Continues to guide MLflow references in tutorials/how-tos. |

## How to contribute

- When drafting new ADRs, add them to this index with a short status summary.
- Update the "Documentation strategy alignment" section whenever the landing
  page or governance artefacts shift so consumers know where to look first.
- Reference relevant ADRs from pull requests to maintain traceability between
  code, docs, and decisions.
