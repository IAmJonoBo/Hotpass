# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution — let’s keep it sharp and fun.

## Ground rules

- Use **Conventional Commits** in PR titles. Example: `feat(auth): support PKCE`.
- Keep PRs small and focused; ship incremental, reversible changes.
- If an LLM helped, say so in the PR body and link to `/docs/ai/COPILOT_USAGE.md`.

## How to

1. Fork → branch from `main`.
2. Add tests. Update docs if behaviour changes.
3. Run the full test suite and linters locally.
4. Open a PR; fill the checklist; wait for review (human + bots).
5. On approve and green CI, we squash merge.

See `/docs/community/CONTRIBUTING.md` for project‑wide details.
