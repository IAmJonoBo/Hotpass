title: Reference — industry profiles
summary: Schema, required blocks, and optional research metadata for Hotpass industry profiles.

Hotpass industry profiles describe how spreadsheets are ingested, normalised, enriched,
and governed. Profiles are expressed as YAML (one per file under `apps/data-platform/hotpass/profiles/`) and
drive both the CLI defaults and the adaptive research orchestrator.

## Required structure

Profiles must provide four blocks — ingest, refine, enrich, compliance — plus core metadata.
The profile linter (`python tools/profile_lint.py`) enforces the shape shown below.

```yaml
name: aviation
display_name: Aviation & Flight Training
# Optional global defaults
default_country_code: ZA
organization_term: flight_school

# Block 1 — ingest
ingest:
  sources:
    - name: SACAA Cleaned
      format: xlsx
      path_pattern: "data/*sacaa*.xlsx"
      priority: 3
  chunk_size: 5000
  staging_enabled: true

# Block 2 — refine
refine:
  mappings:
    organization_name:
      - school_name
      - institution_name
  deduplication:
    strategy: entity_resolution
    threshold: 0.85
  expectations:
    - expect_column_values_to_not_be_null:
        column: organization_name

# Block 3 — enrich
enrich:
  allow_network: false
  fetcher_chain:
    - deterministic
    - lookup_tables
    - research

# Block 4 — compliance
compliance:
  policy: POPIA
  pii_fields:
    - contact_primary_email
```

### Metadata fields

| Field                  | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                 | Machine-readable identifier (also used as filename).            |
| `display_name`         | Human-readable label surfaced in CLI output.                    |
| `default_country_code` | ISO country code used for normalisation defaults.               |
| `organization_term`    | Domain-specific term used in user messaging.                    |
| `source_priorities`    | Legacy priority map; superseded by `ingest.sources[].priority`. |
| `column_synonyms`      | Legacy synonym map; migrated to `refine.mappings`.              |

## Optional research metadata

Sprint 6 introduced additional fields that extend enrichment planning without breaking
existing profiles:

- `authority_sources`: list of trusted registries/directories queried before general web search. Each entry supports `name`, optional `url`, `cache_key`, and a `category` (`registry`, `directory`, or `dataset`).
- `research_backfill`: controls which fields the orchestrator may backfill. Define `fields` (list of column names) and `confidence_threshold` (0–1).
- `research_rate_limit`: throttling hints for network enrichment/crawl steps. Set `min_interval_seconds` (>= 0) to enforce a minimum delay between remote calls; optional `burst` allows that many back-to-back calls before the delay is enforced again (the burst resets once the interval elapses).
- `tools/profile_lint.py --json` emits machine-readable lint summaries for quality gates, while `--schema-json` documents the expected structure for contributors.

```yaml
authority_sources:
  - name: South African Civil Aviation Authority
    url: https://www.caa.co.za/
    cache_key: sacaa
    category: registry
research_backfill:
  fields:
    - contact_primary_email
    - website
  confidence_threshold: 0.7
```

Every native crawl stores a JSON snapshot under `.hotpass/research_runs/<entity-slug>/crawl/<timestamp>.json`
containing the query (if supplied), resolved URLs, and metadata returned by the fetchers. Profiles declaring
rate limits ensure these artefacts reflect the throttled schedule, making audits and retries deterministic.

### Provider guardrails

- Define `research_rate_limit.min_interval_seconds` and `burst` per profile to control cadence; the orchestrator enforces these limits for both deterministic and network passes.
- Use environment flags `FEATURE_ENABLE_REMOTE_RESEARCH` / `ALLOW_NETWORK_RESEARCH` to gate remote fetchers (documented in `AGENTS.md`).
- `ops/quality/ta_history_report.py` and `.hotpass/research_runs/` outputs provide audit trails for rate-limit tuning and provider SLA reviews.

Profiles omitting these sections remain valid; the orchestrator simply skips the authority/backfill
passes.

## Validation workflow

- The profile linter (`python tools/profile_lint.py`) guards structural compliance and is invoked in QG‑1.
- Contract tests (`tests/profiles/test_quality_gates.py`) ensure governed profiles align with Great Expectations suites.
- When authoring new profiles, run `python tools/profile_lint.py --profile <name>` locally and update
  `docs/reference/profiles.md` if introducing new optional fields.

## Authoring checklist

1. Copy an existing profile (for example `apps/data-platform/hotpass/profiles/generic.yaml`).
2. Update the metadata block and ingest/refine/enrich/compliance sections.
3. Declare any authority sources or backfillable fields required for adaptive research.
4. Run the linter and quality gates (`uv run hotpass qa profiles`) before committing.
