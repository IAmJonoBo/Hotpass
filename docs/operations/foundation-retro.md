# Phase 1 foundation retro plan

Phase 1 established the groundwork for Hotpass: the data refinement baseline,
governance scaffolding, and operational guardrails that make later phases
repeatable. This document reconciles the committed scope with what shipped and
outlines the retrospective plan that precedes the `operations/foundation-retro`
pull request.

## Scope reconciliation

| Theme | Delivered capabilities | Follow-ups |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Data refinement baseline | CLI workflow to ingest, normalise, and export the canonical spreadsheet datasets; deterministic schema regeneration into `schemas/`; regression coverage for critical transforms. | Monitor property-based coverage as Phase 2 expands idempotency checks. |
| Governance & documentation | Programme roadmap (`ROADMAP.md` + `docs/roadmap.md`), governance charter, and evidence ledger refreshed; Diátaxis navigation surfaces contracts, Data Docs, and lineage references. | Keep `docs/governance/data-governance-navigation.md` updated with every governance artefact change. |
| Operational readiness | Prefect bootstrapping scripts, telemetry instrumentation, and ARC runner manifests landed with lifecycle verifier support. | Execute the snapshot-backed lifecycle verifier on each infrastructure change until live clusters are available. |

All planned Phase 1 deliverables reached “done” with the exception of the live
ARC smoke test; Platform will complete that once staging access opens in Phase 5.

## Retro agenda

1. **Foundations review (20 min)** — walk through the table above, highlighting
   what accelerated downstream phases and any surprises encountered.
2. **Quality signals (15 min)** — review Data Docs, schema exports, and telemetry
   dashboards that demonstrate the baseline is trustworthy.
3. **Operational guardrails (15 min)** — confirm the ARC lifecycle verifier,
   Prefect bootstrap, and QA automation are ready for scale-out.
4. **Action capture (10 min)** — record residual work in `Next_Steps.md` and the
   roadmap, assigning owners and due dates.

## Participants

- Programme lead (facilitator)
- Engineering representative (contracts + pipeline)
- QA representative (validation + automation)
- Platform representative (ARC + infrastructure)
- Docs representative (governance + navigation)

## Pre-reads and artefacts

- `ROADMAP.md` and [`docs/roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) for the phase summary.
- `Next_Steps.md` for outstanding actions and quality gates.
- [`docs/governance/data-governance-navigation.md`](../governance/data-governance-navigation.md)
  for the governance artefact overview.
- ARC lifecycle snapshot (`scripts/arc/examples/hotpass_arc_idle.json`) and the
  latest verifier run output.

## Expected outcomes

- Agreement that Phase 1 scope is complete and documented.
- Confirmed backlog entries for any residual risks before opening the
  `operations/foundation-retro` PR.
- Shared understanding of the governance navigation guide and how Phase 2 builds
  upon it.
