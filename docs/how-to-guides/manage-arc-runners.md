This guide walks platform engineers through deploying the GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ARC) manifests shipped with Hotpass,
configuring OpenID Connect (OIDC) trust with AWS, and validating that ephemeral runners recycle correctly after each workflow.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with the ARC controller installed (v0.9.0 or later).
- Access to apply manifests in the `arc-runners` namespace.
- `kubectl`, `terraform`, and the GitHub CLI installed locally.
- A GitHub App registered for the organisation or repository that hosts Hotpass workflows.

## 1. Configure GitHub OIDC trust in AWS

The Terraform module under [`infra/arc/terraform`](../../infra/arc/terraform) provisions an IAM role that workflows assume by using
GitHub's OIDC provider. The defaults cover the `main` branch and the `arc-runners` environment while allowing extra subjects if
you need staging cutovers.

```bash
cd infra/arc/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply \
  -var "aws_region=eu-west-1" \
  -var "github_repository=IAmJonoBo/Hotpass" \
  -var 'oidc_subjects=["repo:IAmJonoBo/Hotpass:environment:staging"]'
```

Record the `arc_runner_role_arn` output—workflows use it when assuming AWS credentials. If you store workflow artifacts in a
bucket other than GitHub's default, set `s3_artifact_bucket` to tighten S3 permissions around that location.

## 2. Render Kubernetes manifests

Apply the manifests in [`infra/arc`](../../infra/arc/) to your cluster after supplying real GitHub App credentials (for example via
SOPS or External Secrets). The Kustomize overlay creates the `arc-runners` namespace, configures GitHub metadata, and deploys a
runner scale set tuned for Hotpass workloads.

```bash
kustomize build infra/arc | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Secrets

Replace the placeholder values inside `arc-github-app-secret` with references to your sealed secret or secret manager bindings.
The ARC controller reads the private key and webhook secret to register the scale set with GitHub.

### Scaling parameters

The shipped `RunnerScaleSet` starts at zero runners and allows up to twenty concurrent pods (each requesting 2 vCPUs and 8 GiB of
memory). Tune `minRunners`, `maxRunners`, and container resources if your workloads have different footprints. The companion
`HorizontalRunnerAutoscaler` reacts to queued workflow jobs and scales down after two minutes of idleness.

## 3. Update workflows to assume the runner role

Add OIDC permissions and configure AWS credentials in workflows that should run on the new scale set. The example workflow
[`arc-ephemeral-runner.yml`](../../.github/workflows/arc-ephemeral-runner.yml) demonstrates the pattern:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  smoke:
    runs-on:
      - self-hosted
      - hotpass-arc
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/hotpass-arc-runner
          aws-region: eu-west-1
      - run: uv run python ops/arc/verify_runner_lifecycle.py --owner IAmJonoBo --repository Hotpass --scale-set hotpass-arc --verify-oidc --aws-region eu-west-1
```

Install dependencies for the smoke workflow with `uv sync --extra orchestration --extra platform` to pull in `boto3`, which the
OIDC verification step prefers before falling back to the AWS CLI.

> ℹ️ Set a repository or organisation variable named `AWS_REGION` before dispatching the workflow. The smoke test validates this
> variable explicitly and fails early with a clear error if it is absent.

## 4. Validate runner lifecycle

Run the CLI wrapper (`hotpass arc`) – built on top of [`ops/arc/verify_runner_lifecycle.py`](../../ops/arc/verify_runner_lifecycle.py) – to ensure the scale set drains after a workflow completes. The command mirrors the script options, polls GitHub/Kubernetes until runners terminate, and can optionally verify the AWS identity via OIDC.

```bash
uv run hotpass arc \
  --owner IAmJonoBo \
  --repository Hotpass \
  --scale-set hotpass-arc \
  --namespace arc-runners \
  --verify-oidc \
  --aws-region eu-west-1
```

Use `--output json` if you need machine-readable status checks inside CI or monitoring pipelines.

### Offline rehearsal with snapshots

When clusters are unavailable, supply a snapshot file that mimics pod and runner
states:

```bash
uv run hotpass arc \
  --owner IAmJonoBo \
  --repository Hotpass \
  --scale-set hotpass-arc \
  --snapshot ops/arc/examples/hotpass_arc_idle.json
```

Snapshots let QA and Platform teams verify workflow wiring during dry runs
without requiring Kubernetes or GitHub API access. Update the JSON to match the
expected lifecycle for more advanced rehearsal scenarios.

### Capture staging evidence

When rehearsing against `hotpass-staging`, capture artefacts for programme sign-off:

1. Run `hotpass arc --output json --store-summary` and gather the artefacts stored under `.hotpass/arc/<timestamp>/`.
2. Export AWS STS identity details (or copy the CLI output) to `dist/staging/arc/<timestamp>/sts.txt` to confirm OIDC assumptions.
3. Link both artefacts in `docs/operations/staging-rehearsal-plan.md` and reference them from `Next_Steps.md` before marking the task complete.
4. If access is blocked, note the reason and planned follow-up in `Next_Steps_Log.md`.

## 5. Tear down the runners

When you no longer need the runners, delete the Kubernetes resources and remove the IAM role.

```bash
kustomize build infra/arc | kubectl delete -f -
terraform destroy -var "aws_region=eu-west-1" -var "github_repository=IAmJonoBo/Hotpass"
```

This returns the cluster to its pre-runner state and ensures GitHub can no longer assume the AWS role.
