# How-to — broker agentic runs with Prefect

This guide explains how to use the new Prefect tasks and MCP configuration files to control autonomous agents that want to run the Hotpass refinement pipeline.

## 1. Configure MCP server and client policies

The prototype policies live in [`scripts/agents/`](../../scripts/agents/README.md):

1. Review `mcp_server.yaml` and update the allowlisted tools, repositories, and Prefect deployments to match your environment.
2. Adjust approval routing. Operator and reviewer roles require manual approval in the example policy; analysts are auto-approved.
3. Point the Prefect worker to the policy by exporting `HOTPASS_AGENT_POLICY_PATH=/path/to/mcp_server.yaml` before starting the agent-aware work pool.
4. Distribute `mcp_client.yaml` to agent operators so the correct role and broker endpoint are presented with each request.

## 2. Enable Prefect runtime for agent gating

Set `HOTPASS_ENABLE_PREFECT_RUNTIME=1` in the environment and ensure the orchestration extras are installed (`uv sync --extra orchestration`). The `hotpass.orchestration` module now exposes:

- `evaluate_agent_request` — validates the request against the tool policy and optional manual approval decision.
- `log_agent_action` — records audit entries to Prefect logs and optional sinks.
- `broker_agent_run` — composes the flow: validate the request, run the pipeline, and log both success and denial events.

Example usage inside a Prefect flow:

```python
from hotpass.orchestration import (
    AgenticRequest,
    AgentToolPolicy,
    broker_agent_run,
)

@flow
def agent_entrypoint(request: dict):
    policy = AgentToolPolicy(
        allowed_tools_by_role={"operator": {"prefect"}, "analyst": {"prefect", "github"}},
        auto_approved_roles={"analyst"},
    )
    agent_request = AgenticRequest(**request)
    return broker_agent_run(agent_request, policy)
```

## 3. Capture audit trails

`broker_agent_run` writes structured `AgentAuditRecord` entries. Provide a mutable sequence (for example, a list or a custom log writer) via the `log_sink` argument to persist records to disk or an evidence store:

```python
audit_log: list[AgentAuditRecord] = []
summary = broker_agent_run(agent_request, policy, log_sink=audit_log)
```

Each record captures the decision (`approved`, `denied`, `executed`, or `failed`), approver identity, timestamp, and any result metadata such as the pipeline summary payload. Use this data to back POPIA audit requirements and roadmap quality gates.

## 4. Simulate approvals in tests

The regression suite includes [`tests/test_agentic_orchestration.py`](../../tests/test_agentic_orchestration.py), which demonstrates how to:

- Deny requests when a role attempts to use an unlisted tool.
- Enforce manual approvals for privileged roles.
- Approve and execute a run while capturing audit entries.

Use these patterns when adding new agent roles or tools to ensure the gating logic and audit logging remain covered.
