Use this guide when you need to promote Hotpass from ad-hoc execution to a scheduled, observable service.

## Before you begin

- Install Hotpass with the `orchestration`, `enrichment`, `geospatial`, `compliance`, and `dashboards` extras.
- Provision a Prefect work pool and API key.
- Decide where you want to ship telemetry (stdout, OTLP endpoint, or another backend).

## Create a deployment

Prefect deployments now live as version-controlled manifests under `prefect/`. Apply them with the CLI when you
need to register or refresh deployments:

```bash
uv run hotpass deploy --flow refinement
```

The command loads `prefect/refinement.yaml`, builds a `RunnerDeployment`, and registers it with Prefect without rebuilding or
pushing container images. Specify multiple `--flow` flags to register several manifests in a single run, or omit the flag to
apply every manifest in the directory. Use `--manifest-dir` if you maintain environment-specific overlays (for example,
`prefect/prod/`).

Each manifest encodes the schedule, tags, work pool, and parameter defaults for the flow. The refinement manifest defaults to
incremental execution (`incremental: true`) and exposes a `since` parameter so runs can resume from a saved checkpoint.
Backfill manifests mark `active: false` and inherit the `paused` state automatically, avoiding accidental replays in production.

## Manage secrets and configuration

1. Store credentials such as database URLs and API keys as Prefect blocks or environment variables.
2. Reference them from the pipeline config using Jinja templating:

```yaml
datasources:
  crm:
    type: postgres
    dsn: "{{ env_var('CRM_DSN') }}"
```

3. Update the Prefect deployment to pull secrets at runtime:

```bash
uv run prefect deployment run hotpass-refinement --params '{"since": "2024-11-01"}'
```

## Review probabilistic linkage

Hotpass now persists probabilistic linkage scores and review queues when you
enable entity resolution. Configure thresholds and the review location when
invoking the enhanced orchestrator:

```bash
uv run hotpass orchestrate \
  --profile aviation \
  --enable-entity-resolution \
  --linkage-use-splink \
  --linkage-match-threshold 0.92 \
  --linkage-review-threshold 0.7 \
  --linkage-output-dir dist/linkage \
  --label-studio-url https://labelstudio.example \
  --label-studio-token $LABEL_STUDIO_TOKEN \
  --label-studio-project 12
```

Each run writes the following artefacts under the configured output directory
(default: `dist/linkage/`):

- `linkage_matches.parquet` — scored pairs above the reject threshold.
- `linkage_review_queue.parquet` — pairs routed to clerical review.
- `linkage_metadata.json` — thresholds and record counts for retraining.
- `linkage_reviewer_decisions.jsonl` — reviewer feedback synced from Label Studio.

Label Studio tasks include both the match probability and the configured
thresholds so reviewers understand why a pair requires attention.

## Run adaptive research from the CLI

The `plan research` and `crawl` verbs wrap the adaptive orchestrator. Use them to stage enrichment work or dry-run crawls:

```bash
uv run hotpass plan research \
  --dataset ./dist/refined.xlsx \
  --row-id 0 \
  --url https://example.test \
  --allow-network \
  --json \
  --output dist/research/plan.json

uv run hotpass crawl "https://example.test" --allow-network
```

- Set `FEATURE_ENABLE_REMOTE_RESEARCH=1` and `ALLOW_NETWORK_RESEARCH=1` to permit network fetchers; otherwise the orchestrator remains deterministic.
- `--json` emits the full plan payload, while `--output` writes it to disk alongside the standard console summary.
- CLI coverage in `tests/cli/test_research_plan.py` and `tests/cli/test_resolve_profile.py` ensures profile defaults (Splink, sensitive fields, Label Studio configs) stay intact—mirror those scenarios when adding new profiles or providers.
- Archive plan outputs under `dist/staging/e2e/<timestamp>/` during staging rehearsals so stakeholders can audit proposed crawls.

## Toggle Prefect runtime decorators

During unit tests Hotpass disables Prefect's runtime decorators to avoid starting ephemeral
servers. Set `HOTPASS_ENABLE_PREFECT_RUNTIME=1` before invoking CLI or Prefect commands when
you need the real Prefect runtime behaviour:

```bash
export HOTPASS_ENABLE_PREFECT_RUNTIME=1
uv run hotpass orchestrate --profile aviation
```

Unset the variable (or leave it blank) to fall back to the no-op decorators that keep local
unit tests offline-friendly.

## Enable telemetry

Set the exporter variables before triggering a run. The CLI now routes telemetry through the
shared registry described in [Observability registry and policy](../observability/index.md):

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otel.example.com"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <token>"
export PREFECT_LOGGING_EXTRA_LOGGERS="hotpass,hotpass.enrichment"
```

Then run the orchestrated pipeline:

```bash
uv run hotpass orchestrate --profile aviation --enable-observability
```

Use the Prefect UI or the OTLP backend (Grafana, Datadog, etc.) to verify metrics such as `hotpass.pipeline.duration`, `hotpass.validation.failures`, and `hotpass.enrichment.coverage`. When
customising exporters, inject a bespoke `TelemetryRegistry` via `hotpass.observability.use_registry`
and include a call to `shutdown_observability()` in CLI scripts to flush readers.

## Replay archived inputs with Prefect backfills

Fill historical gaps by replaying archived spreadsheets through the pipeline. The `backfill` command
rehydrates zipped inputs, honours concurrency guardrails, and emits the same metrics that scheduled
runs produce.

1. Store archives in a predictable directory (for example, `dist/input-archives/`).
2. Name bundles consistently such as `hotpass-inputs-YYYYMMDD-v{version}.zip` or adjust the
   `orchestrator.backfill.archive_pattern` setting to match your layout.
3. Execute the backfill command, overriding dates or versions as required:

```bash
uv run hotpass backfill \
  --config configs/prod.json \
  --start-date 2024-01-01 \
  --end-date 2024-01-03 \
  --version v1 \
  --version v2 \
  --archive-root /data/hotpass/input-archives \
  --restore-root /tmp/hotpass/backfill
```

Each run extracts to `<restore-root>/YYYY-MM-DD--version/`, writes refined workbooks under
`<restore-root>/outputs/`, and reports summary metrics to Prefect. Concurrency is governed by the
canonical configuration (`orchestrator.backfill.concurrency_limit` and `concurrency_key`), aligning
with the operational guardrails described in [Prefect governance](../governance/pr-playbook.md#prefect-deployments).
Setting `concurrency_limit` to `0` or leaving Prefect unavailable forces sequential execution, and the
flow automatically falls back to synchronous runs if Prefect cannot acquire slots—useful for CI or
air-gapped environments.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing extras**: `ModuleNotFoundError` for Prefect or OpenTelemetry means the extras were not installed. Re-run `uv sync` with the required extras.
- **Telemetry write errors**: When running offline, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=console` to avoid network timeouts.
- **Flow concurrency**: Prefect limits concurrency per work pool. Adjust `--concurrency-limit` or use work-queue level settings.
