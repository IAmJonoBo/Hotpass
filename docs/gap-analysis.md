### Identified Gaps

## 1. Industry-Specific Hardcoding (White-Label Gap)

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- Industry profiles are defined as YAML templates with configurable terminology, default country codes, source priorities, and validation thresholds.
- The default `aviation` and `generic` profiles expose column synonym dictionaries consumed by the column mapping layer.
- CLI and pipeline configuration allow swapping profiles without code changes, and profile metadata flows into quality reports.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Locale-aware normalization is still biased toward South African provinces and phone formats.
- Profile authoring remains manual (YAML edits) with no validation wizard or UI to guide non-developers.
- Consent, provenance, and retention defaults are not yet parameterized per jurisdiction.

**Impact:** Cross-border adoption now starts from a working baseline but still requires manual tweaks for region-specific compliance and normalization.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Expand locale libraries (addresses, phone patterns, provinces) beyond South Africa and surface per-profile overrides.
- Provide a `profile doctor` akin to the configuration doctor to validate and scaffold new industries.
- Introduce consent/provenance templates that inject jurisdiction-specific defaults into downstream data products.

## 2. Intelligent Column Detection & Mapping

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- `ColumnMapper` leverages profile-driven synonym dictionaries and fuzzy matching helpers to map variant headers.
- `profile_dataframe` and `infer_column_types` provide automated profiling and semantic inference to support mapping decisions.
- Mapping results surface confidence buckets and suggestions, reducing the need for code changes when schemas drift.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Confidence scoring is heuristic; no ML-backed ranking or feedback loop yet.
- No interactive UI or review workflow for analysts to accept/override mappings in bulk.
- Synonym dictionaries ship with core profiles; crowdsourced or learned expansions are not automated.

**Impact:** Day-to-day schema drift is handled gracefully, but onboarding net-new feeds still leans on developers for review and tuning.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Add pluggable scorers (TF-IDF, rapidfuzz ratios, ML embeddings) and capture analyst feedback to improve suggestions.
- Build a lightweight review surface (CLI TUI or web) to approve mappings and export overrides.
- Persist accepted mappings to profile-local overrides so corrections flow back into future runs automatically.

## 3. Validation Intelligence

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- Industry profiles now own validation thresholds (email/phone/website) and the pipeline surfaces per-rule quality scores.
- Great Expectations integrates with manual fallbacks to ensure rule execution even when dependencies are unavailable.
- Quality reports expose distribution metrics, invalid record counts, and recommendation scaffolding for remediation.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Recommendations remain template-based; no adaptive tuning from historical results.
- Graduated scoring exists but needs clearer definitions for stakeholders (excellent/good/fair/poor bands).
- Trend tracking across runs is manual; no persisted history or anomaly detection.

**Impact:** Users receive richer validation feedback, yet long-term monitoring and adaptive tuning require additional automation.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Persist validation outcomes per run to anchor trend charts and drift detection.
- Introduce configurable quality score bands in profile definitions and expose them in reports.
- Experiment with rule auto-tuning (e.g., recalibrating `mostly` thresholds) based on observed distributions under analyst supervision.

## 4. Spreadsheet Formatting & Presentation

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- `export_to_multiple_formats` delivers Excel, CSV, Parquet, and JSON outputs with shared formatting rules.
- `OutputFormat` enables header styling, zebra striping, filters, and conditional color scales driven by quality scores.
- Quality reports include HTML/Markdown renderers, giving stakeholders instant summaries without manual workbooks.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Summary tabs and visual dashboards are still handcrafted outside the core pipeline.
- Formatting presets are code-defined; analysts cannot yet configure them via declarative files.
- Charting/visualization primitives are absent from the packaged outputs.

**Impact:** Day-one exports look professional, yet decision-makers still assemble bespoke dashboards for deeper analysis.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Generate optional summary worksheets (KPIs, charts) based on quality report metrics.
- Externalize formatting presets into profile-level config with validation to support brand-specific themes.
- Explore lightweight chart generation (matplotlib/plotly exports) for inclusion in reports and HTML outputs.

## 5. Edge Case & Error Handling

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- `ErrorHandler` centralizes handling with structured categories, severities, and Markdown/HTML reporting.
- Validation errors emit contextual suggestions and provenance (field, value, row, source file).
- Pipeline supports non-fatal execution when `fail_fast=False`, enabling batch processing even with recoverable issues.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- No automated quarantine output for problematic records; analysts manually filter them from reports.
- Retry/backoff strategies are still TODO for transient source failures.
- Error dashboards are limited to textual reports without drill-down capabilities.

**Impact:** Operators receive actionable diagnostics, but remediation workflows remain manual and time-consuming for large datasets.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Emit dedicated quarantine datasets (CSV/Parquet) for records flagged by severity.
- Integrate retry logic for IO-bound operations (S3/HTTP) with configurable policies.
- Push error telemetry to observability stack (e.g., Prometheus events) to enable live dashboards.

## 6. Multi-Person Organization Handling

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- `OrganizationContacts` aggregates multiple contact records per organization with preference scoring.
- Contact consolidation utilities merge multi-row datasets and expose helper methods (`get_primary_contact`, `get_all_emails`).
- Quality reports surface conflict resolutions for contact fields, improving transparency.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- No temporal history or lifecycle tracking for contacts (joins/leaves, role changes).
- Department/team hierarchies and relationship modelling are still future work.
- Preference scoring is heuristic; needs calibration data and explainability for stakeholders.

**Impact:** Day-to-day consolidation is automated, yet sales/CS teams still maintain external systems for relationship context.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Persist contact history snapshots to track changes over time and expose churn metrics.
- Model contact-to-contact relationships (manager, colleague) and support department tagging.
- Allow profile-level weighting inputs (e.g., prioritise verified emails) and expose reasoning in reports.

## 7. File Consolidation Intelligence

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- Loaders encapsulate source-specific normalisation and provenance tagging.
- Conflict resolution logs include chosen values, alternatives, and source priorities in the quality report.
- Benchmark harness measures aggregation throughput and exposes performance metrics.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Duplicate detection still relies on basic heuristics; fuzzy entity resolution is on the roadmap.
- No scenario planning or backtesting for alternative merge strategies.
- Lineage visualisation is text-based; no graphical representation of merge decisions.

**Impact:** Conflict handling is transparent, but analysts must script advanced dedupe/what-if experiments externally.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Integrate probabilistic matching (e.g., Splink) for multi-field duplicate detection with confidence scores.
- Expose a configuration flag to simulate alternative source priorities and compare outcomes.
- Generate lineage exports (graphviz/JSON) to support visual dashboards and governance needs.

## 8. Configuration & User Experience

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- CLI exposes rich help text, JSON logging, and archive packaging options.
- `PipelineConfig` accepts TOML/JSON inputs, with configuration doctor tooling catching common issues.
- Documentation now includes quick-start and implementation guides with annotated examples.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Still no interactive wizard or GUI for assembling configs.
- Error messaging for invalid config files could be friendlier (links to docs, suggestions).
- Discoverability of advanced flags lives in docs rather than contextual prompts.

**Impact:** Power users operate efficiently, but newcomers face a learning curve and rely heavily on documentation.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Ship a guided `hotpass init` command to scaffold configs via prompts.
- Explore a lightweight web or desktop UI for common run modes and status dashboards.
- Add contextual suggestions (did-you-mean) when parsing configs and CLI flags fails.

## 9. Data Profiling & Schema Inference

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- `profile_dataframe` summarises row counts, missingness, uniqueness, and sample values automatically.
- Column type inference tags semantic categories (email, phone, url) to accelerate validation setup.
- Quality reports include distribution metrics and recommendations derived from profiling output.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- No persisted profiling history to compare across runs or flag drift automatically.
- Outlier detection and statistical summaries remain basic; no z-score or percentile analysis yet.
- Visualizations (histograms, heatmaps) are not generated as part of the profiling output.

**Impact:** Initial profiling is automated, but analysts still export data into notebooks/BI tools for longitudinal analysis.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Store profiling snapshots with timestamps to enable drift dashboards and trending.
- Expand statistical measures (percentiles, variance, outlier thresholds) and expose them via API/CLI.
- Generate optional visual artifacts (PNG/HTML charts) to embed directly in reports.

## 10. Logging, Monitoring & Audit Trail

**Current State (Oct 2025):**

- CLI supports rich and JSON logging with per-stage timing via the performance metrics block.
- Quality reports capture audit trail entries (pipeline start/end, validation checkpoints, conflict resolutions).
- Benchmark script (`scripts/benchmark_pipeline.py`) provides repeatable performance baselines.

**Remaining Gaps:**

- Logs are ephemeral; no centralized sink or retention policy.
- Alerting/monitoring hooks (metrics, tracing) are not yet wired into observability platforms.
- Change history for configuration/profile updates lives in git but is not summarised for operators.

**Impact:** Troubleshooting is possible post-run using artifacts, but proactive monitoring and compliance reporting remain manual.

**Next Enhancements:**

- Ship OpenTelemetry exporters (logs/metrics) and document recommended sinks (Grafana, Datadog).
- Persist run metadata (validation results, performance metrics) to a lightweight store for dashboards.
- Automate change summaries (profiles, expectations) so releases include governance-ready reports.
