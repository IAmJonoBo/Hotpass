# Compliance — ISO 27001 maturity matrix

| Control (Annex A)                 | Current maturity                                                                            | Target state                                                                       | Gap & risk                                                                    | Risk severity | Evidence                                                                                                                                                      | Control owner          | Remediation                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A.5 Information security policies | Governance charter defines scope and responsibilities, but no formal approval cycle.        | Policy reviewed and approved quarterly with version history and sign-off log.      | Without approval trail, auditors cannot confirm leadership endorsement.       | Medium        | [`docs/governance/project-charter.md`](../../governance/project-charter.md).                                                                                  | Leadership             | [Backlog: ISO27001-001](../remediation-backlog.md#iso27001-001-establish-policy-approval-cycle) |
| A.8 Asset management              | Architecture doc lists critical assets; asset inventory not centralised nor classified.     | Config-managed asset register with classification and owners.                      | Missing inventory may hide unmanaged PII stores.                              | High          | [`docs/explanations/architecture.md`](../../explanations/architecture.md); asset register to live under `data/inventory/asset-register.yaml`.                 | Security & Platform    | [Backlog: ISO27001-002](../remediation-backlog.md#iso27001-002-build-asset-register)            |
| A.12 Operations security          | CI workflow runs QA suite, but change logging for config doctor decisions not recorded.     | Immutable audit log for operational changes and Prefect configuration adjustments. | Lack of logging weakens change traceability for security-critical tuning.     | Medium        | [`.github/workflows/process-data.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/process-data.yml); [`src/hotpass/config_doctor.py`](../../../src/hotpass/config_doctor.py). | Engineering            | [Backlog: ISO27001-003](../remediation-backlog.md#iso27001-003-extend-ops-logging)              |
| A.15 Supplier relationships       | No supplier risk assessment recorded for Prefect Cloud, Slack, or survey tools.             | Approved supplier list with risk ratings and review cadence.                       | Unassessed suppliers can introduce compliance gaps and data residency issues. | High          | [`docs/metrics/metrics-plan.md`](../../metrics/metrics-plan.md) assumptions; supplier register to be documented at `docs/governance/supplier-register.md`.    | Procurement & Security | [Backlog: ISO27001-004](../remediation-backlog.md#iso27001-004-define-supplier-risk-register)   |
| A.18 Compliance                   | Detect-secrets and Bandit run, but legal/regulatory compliance matrix absent pre-this work. | Integrated compliance mapping with periodic legal review and evidence refresh.     | Without consolidated compliance matrix, obligations may be missed.            | Medium        | This document set; QA command history in `Next_Steps.md`.                                                                                                     | Compliance             | [Backlog: ISO27001-005](../remediation-backlog.md#iso27001-005-schedule-legal-reviews)          |

Unknowns:

- Determine if existing SOC 2 readiness assessments can be reused for ISO 27001 Annex A evidence.
- Confirm whether customer-managed hosting introduces shared responsibility splits requiring updated policies.
