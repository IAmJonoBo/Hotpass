# Compliance evidence workspace

This directory stores quarterly verification artefacts, including:

- `verification-log.json` — machine-readable ledger of POPIA/ISO 27001/SOC 2 cadence runs.
- `dsar/` — data subject access request exports and automation logs.
- `reports/` — rendered verification summaries for leadership reviews.

Artefacts should be retained for at least one year. Rotate sensitive exports after uploading
to the central evidence catalog referenced in the compliance roadmap.
