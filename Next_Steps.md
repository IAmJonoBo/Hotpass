# Next Steps

## Tasks
- [x] Restore ≥85% coverage by expanding integration tests for enhanced CLI, observability, enrichment, and geospatial flows (Owner: Engineering, Due: 2025-11-07)【2764d8†L1-L85】
- [x] Refactor `hotpass-enhanced dashboard` subprocess launch to satisfy Bandit B603/B607 (Owner: Engineering, Due: 2025-11-06)
- [ ] Validate Docker image build and publish pipeline in CI (Owner: DevOps, Due: 2025-11-08)
- [x] Harden Splink fallback path to operate when slug data is missing (Owner: Engineering, Due: 2025-11-07)
- [x] Update public docs (README, Implementation Status) to reflect current coverage (67%) and outstanding risk items (Owner: Product, Due: 2025-11-06)
- [ ] Quieten Prefect/OpenTelemetry console handlers to prevent ValueError on process shutdown during QA tooling (Owner: Engineering, Due: 2025-11-08)【2764d8†L86-L112】【ea482f†L1-L44】
- [ ] Refresh release-facing docs (`IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `RELEASE_SUMMARY.md`) with actual gate outcomes and remaining gaps (Owner: Product, Due: 2025-11-09)【F:IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md†L1-L178】【F:RELEASE_SUMMARY.md†L1-L120】

## Steps
- [x] Added mandatory runtime dependencies (Prefect, OpenTelemetry, Requests, Trafilatura, Detect-Secrets, types-PyYAML) to unblock imports across orchestration/enrichment paths
- [x] Guarded compliance/enrichment/geospatial tests with `pytest.importorskip` to make optional integrations explicit
- [x] Patched Presidio fallback to expose stub attributes for mocking when the library is absent
- [x] Normalised Streamlit runner invocation to avoid passing redundant `run` subcommand and verified CLI dashboard launch (Owner: Engineering)【38226c†L1-L2】【9475cb†L1-L10】
- [ ] Re-enable skipped integration suites once optional dependencies can be installed in CI without instability
- [ ] Create dedicated fixtures for observability and orchestration to reduce reliance on global state between tests

## Deliverables
- [x] Updated `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` reflecting required runtime dependencies for observability/orchestration/enrichment
- [x] Adjusted tests under `tests/test_observability.py`, `tests/test_orchestration.py`, `tests/test_pipeline_enhanced.py`, `tests/test_enrichment.py`, and `tests/test_geospatial.py` to skip gracefully when integrations are missing
- [x] Enhanced `src/hotpass/compliance.py` to expose stubbed Presidio APIs when unavailable, keeping tests patchable
- [x] Add regression tests for Splink fallback covering slug synthesis and empty-column scenarios
- [x] Document required extras per CLI command in README/Implementation_Status

- [x] Pytest with coverage ≥ 80% (current: 85%)【2764d8†L1-L85】
- [x] Ruff lint clean (`uv run ruff check`)【ea482f†L1-L45】
- [x] Mypy type checks clean (`uv run mypy src tests scripts`)【0f47f6†L1-L3】
- [x] Bandit security scan clean (`uv run bandit -r src scripts`)【3831b7†L1-L24】
- [x] Detect-secrets scan clean (`uv run detect-secrets scan src tests scripts`)【3d2341†L1-L42】
- [ ] Docker image build validated (pending CI execution)
- [x] Documentation alignment (README/Implementation_Status updated)【F:README.md†L4-L11】【F:IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md†L160-L178】

## Risks / Notes
- Observability console exporter raises `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` after QA commands due to Prefect handlers flushing to a closed stream; ensure graceful shutdown before enabling in CI【2764d8†L86-L112】【ea482f†L1-L44】.
- Docker build validation remains unverified within current environment—ensure CI pipeline exercises Dockerfile and records results.
- Prefect telemetry exporters still raise SSL errors when orchestrating flows in offline environments; needs hardened configuration or opt-out for air-gapped runs【6462ae†L4-L34】.
- Updated dependency surface increases install footprint—monitor for longer build times in CI and adjust caching strategies accordingly.
