## Risks / Notes

- Observability exporters now suppress shutdown ValueErrors; monitor CI logs after enabling full telemetry backends.
- Docker build validation now executes in CI via workflow docker build step; monitor runtime and cache behaviour in hosted runners.
- Prefect telemetry exporters still raise SSL errors when orchestrating flows in offline environments; needs hardened configuration or opt-out for air-gapped runs.
- Baseline QA suite now passes with Splink linkage extras; ensure `python-stdnum`/`nameparser` remain available in packaged environments to avoid regressions.【e8ff23†L1-L84】
- Fitness function guard continues to fail because `pipeline.py` exceeds 1300 lines; requires targeted refactor before quality gate can be marked green.【cbd1b5†L1-L4】
- Semgrep auto-config retrieval fails under current SSL policy; rerun once trust anchors are available or pin an offline config for sandbox QA.【6c2e8a†L1-L66】
- Pytest coverage sits at ~88% with probabilistic linkage regression tests; monitor optional dependency install times in CI.【e8ff23†L1-L84】
- Ruff lint gate restored after normalizer import cleanup; revisit UP038 tuple `isinstance` refactor separately to avoid churn during linkage rollout.【5d6446†L1-L2】
- Docs link checking ignores selected external domains because of certificate issues in the sandbox; confirm connectivity in GitHub-hosted runners.
- Metrics instrumentation relies on access to Prefect Orion API, Slack webhooks, and optional Four Keys stack—validate connectivity and compliance approvals before rollout.
- Trust-boundary updates highlight new follow-ups (dashboard auth, secrets handling, CI artefact retention, Docker distribution); track owners above.
- Canonical configuration schema now powers CLI/Prefect flows; monitor downstream consumers for assumptions about legacy option dictionaries.
- Compliance matrices highlight outstanding DSAR automation, supplier assessments, and storage hardening—monitor backlog deadlines and update evidence catalog after each delivery.
- Gap analysis surfaced orchestration duplication, logging shims, entity history parsing, geospatial scaling, and audit logging coverage gaps—see new tasks for mitigation sequencing.
- Evidence paths (`data/logs/prefect/`, `data/compliance/dsar/`, `data/inventory/`, `dist/logs/access/`) now ship with READMEs; confirm retention SLAs with Compliance and Platform owners.
- Vault strategy published; next step is implementing Vault-backed delivery for CI and Prefect plus monitoring audit logs post-cutover.
- Local Semgrep ruleset focuses on high-risk patterns (eval, shell=True); expand coverage with additional rules as the backlog evolves.
- Mutation suite now exercises observability toggles in `pipeline_enhanced`; rerun kill rate report after next mutation sweep.
- CLI progress instrumentation still requires high-volume stress verification to validate operator feedback loops (tracked above).
- Shared-secret dashboard password still requires rotation and monitoring until SSO-backed auth replaces it; integrate Vault-issued credentials during rollout.
- Consent validation logs need exporting to evidence catalog once Prefect automation is wired up; track via new audit task.
- Quarterly verification automation now logs cadences; future runs must attach DSAR and supplier review findings to keep evidence meaningful.
- Ruff formatter drift resolved via repository-wide sweep; keep formatter gate enforced in CI and rerun after major merges.
- Bandit baseline flags a low-severity `try/except/pass` in `src/hotpass/linkage/runner.py`; evaluate remediation or justification alongside storage/pipeline refactors.【a009d0†L5-L27】
