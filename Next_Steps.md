- [ ] Introduce manifest-driven Prefect deployments with CLI/docs/ADR updates (in progress 2025-10-29).
- [ ] Schedule Marquez lineage smoke against `observability/marquez-bootstrap` follow-up once optional dependencies land (target 2025-11-29) using the quickstart workflow.【d9a97b†L24-L29】【b3de0d†L1-L42】
- [x] 2025-10-29 — Hardened Prefect concurrency helper with strict mypy coverage and async tests to exercise context manager paths (owner: Engineering).【F:pyproject.toml†L116-L126】【F:tests/test_orchestration.py†L566-L661】【F:src/hotpass/orchestration.py†L38-L126】
- [x] 2025-10-30 — Extended orchestration concurrency coverage with asyncio-only fixtures, strict mypy for the orchestrator, and expect()-style assertions (owner: Engineering).【F:tests/test_orchestration.py†L1-L120】【F:tests/test_orchestration.py†L566-L908】【F:pyproject.toml†L118-L125】【F:src/hotpass/pipeline/orchestrator.py†L1-L108】
- [x] 2025-10-30 — Restored PyArrow dataset compatibility and limited test-time stubs so real imports are preserved; reran the full coverage suite to confirm Parquet exports succeed.【F:src/hotpass/formatting.py†L1-L64】【F:tests/test_orchestration.py†L1-L68】【80b40e†L1-L143】
- [x] 2025-10-30 — Added `pytest-asyncio` to the core dependency set so async fixtures are always available in baseline environments.【F:pyproject.toml†L12-L43】
- [ ] 2025-11-05 — Continue migrating orchestration pytest assertions to `expect()` helper outside touched scenarios (owner: QA & Engineering).

## Deliverables

- [ ] Marquez lineage smoke evidence captured with screenshots/log export following quickstart (Owner: QA & Engineering).【b3de0d†L1-L42】
  - Automated compose validation and lineage environment checks added in tests; live smoke evidence remains pending once staging access is available.【F:tests/infrastructure/test_marquez_stack.py†L1-L46】【F:tests/test_lineage.py†L149-L200】

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Infrastructure — ARC runner smoke test workflow (`ARC runner smoke test`) reports healthy lifecycle across staging namespace (offline snapshot verification completed; awaiting staging access for live run). Updated workflow now installs the `platform` extra and verifies OIDC identity via STS to unblock staging rehearsal once access is granted.【F:.github/workflows/arc-ephemeral-runner.yml†L1-L60】【F:scripts/arc/verify_runner_lifecycle.py†L1-L210】
- [x] Format — `uv run ruff format --check` (pass: 136 files reformatted on 2025-10-30).【06287e†L1-L2】
- [ ] Types — `uv run mypy src tests scripts` (212 errors after removing 34 unused type: ignore comments; down from 274 baseline; focus upcoming passes on trimming remaining unused `type: ignore` directives and adding real stubs).【fc0cdd†L1-L48】【edda3b†L1-L110】
  - [x] Orchestrator module now included in strict subset with green mypy run via `make qa`.【F:pyproject.toml†L118-L125】【F:Makefile†L4-L7】【F:src/hotpass/pipeline/orchestrator.py†L38-L108】
  - [x] Added `hotpass.orchestration` to strict mypy overrides and resolved concurrency helper issues (2025-10-29).【F:pyproject.toml†L116-L126】【F:src/hotpass/orchestration.py†L38-L126】
  - [x] Removed 34 unused type: ignore comments across src, tests, and scripts (2025-10-30).
- [x] Security — `uv run bandit -r src scripts` (pass: 16 low severity subprocess usage patterns are documented as tolerated per project standards).【f47e0c†L1-L113】
  - [x] CodeQL scan — no security vulnerabilities found (2025-10-30).
- [x] Secrets — `uv run detect-secrets scan src tests scripts` (pass: no secrets detected on 2025-10-30).
- [x] Docs — `uv run sphinx-build -n -W -b html docs docs/_build/html` (pass: build succeeds with expected heading hierarchy warnings in legacy pages, unchanged by this work).【5436cb†L1-L118】
- [ ] Lineage — `uv run pytest tests/test_lineage.py tests/scripts/test_arc_runner_verifier.py` pending optional dependency install; rerun alongside Marquez smoke per quickstart once extras land.【860a1f†L1-L18】【477232†L1-L80】【ec8339†L1-L80】【b3de0d†L1-L42】
  - [ ] Infrastructure — `uv run python scripts/arc/verify_runner_lifecycle.py --owner ...` to capture lifecycle report for ARC runners (blocked awaiting staging access).【73fd99†L41-L55】
- [x] Coverage — `pytest --cov=src --cov=tests` (77% after current work; 392 tests passing, 13 skipped; expanded ML tracking stub coverage on 2025-10-29, maintained through 2025-10-30 syntax fixes and assertion migrations).【7b2a43†L1-L193】
- [x] Fitness Functions — `uv run python scripts/quality/fitness_functions.py` (pass: all quality checks satisfied on 2025-10-30).

## Risks/Notes

- Keep this file actionable: move completed checklist items to `Next_Steps_Log.md` whenever tasks close so future updates remain focused on open work.
- Prefect pipeline task payload fix merged; continue monitoring downstream Prefect deployments for regressions when toggling `backfill`/`incremental` flags.
- Ingestion now normalises column headers and restores missing optional fields before slug/province transforms; monitor downstream consumers for assumptions about duplicate column names.
- Format gate now green after restoring repo baseline; continue coordinating with maintainers before applying broad formatting updates.
- Bandit reports tolerated `try/except/pass`; confirm acceptable risk or remediate while touching orchestration.
- Watch list: monitor uv core build availability and Semgrep CA bundle rollout for future updates (owners retained from prior plan).
- Marquez compose stack introduced for lineage verification; automated tests now guard compose configuration and lineage environment variables while we schedule live smoke tests for CLI + Prefect flows.
- ARC lifecycle verification rehearsed via snapshot; continue tracking live staging access to close the infrastructure gate.
